# Functional-Firewall
Status: Alpha (planning).

## Current Concept/Prompt...
```
how would one make ones own learning firewall for windows 10, it would be similar to "Malwarebytes Windows Firewall Control" in that it would extend the built-in windows firewall,  can we make some C+ or C# scripts, with its own installer to compile at install, something like...

Additionally...
- tray would need a right click "Turn Firewall On/Off".
- when new connection from given app, then we would want popup, it would say app details/location, inbound/outbound,  Allow / AllowCapture / AlloeAlways / DenyOnce / DenyRestart / DenyAlways. While for there to be a countdown of 5 minutes, defaulting to deny once."
-  Allow capture would require some kind of window to popup, where there would be live logged information about files accessed locally by the specific application, and what its doing/done, including registry etc, until the window is closed.
- Deny restart would deny until restarted.
- By Default all windows stuff that is not actually required for, web browser and online games such as secondlife and python pip and web requests from python, should be allowed. It should be a default policy for someone who likes to go online, but does either, not trust microsoft outside of critical processes and/or intends to save as much bandwidth as possible by choosing not to update/haveAdvancedFeatures.

The tray context window...
Upon running the program AND by right clicking on the tray, then the user should be able to right click in the context window for "Manage Policies", the main program window will popup, if closed then AND minimizes, to tray window, it would be a tabbed interface along the top, 
- main tab has all policies listed for allow/deny options selected. there would be table with clickable data field titles, to sort data by those fields...App Name , Policy Set, Full  Path, First File Accessed, First File Modified, First File Created, First IP Accessed. For the first hour of operation, then apps that are Allowed would be monitored, First File Accessed, First File Modified, First File Created, First IP Accessed, would be monitored for the first hour of operation, thus allowing for the nature of the given apps we are allowing to be somewhat known. Missing fields will be handled by leaving the field blank. 
- There would be maintenance of 
- Files Accessed (last file accessed, clicking on produces new tab with first 100  files accessed), Files Modified (Last File modified, clicked on produces list of first 100 files updated), Files Created , IP History (list history of IP's accessed, limit to last accessed, cache first 100 and have as popup list window if user clicks on last accessed, ignore 100+ other than last accessed, this way bypass heavy maintenance of multiple rotations going on), . 

Hence once installed then the user is intended to setup base policies by just running the thing and configuring additional policies, allowing things to run for an hour to capture most of the base stuff, and allow the system to build up its information.

### Structure...
```
.\Functional-Firewall.bat
.\launcher.*  (entry point for compiled program)
.\installer.py  (compiling/install script)
.\scripts\* (other scripts for the program)
.\data\persistent.*  (generated by installer, for program settings)
.\data\actions_tasks.*   (generated by installer, for program/system maintenance, checked upon main program initialization). 
.\data\constants.ini   (generated by installer, for constants/detections from installer  
.\data\tray_icon_off.ico
.\data\tray_icon_on.ico
.\data\*   (other data files, such as databases for policies)
